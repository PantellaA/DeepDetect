#DeepDetect 
##Repository Structure Overview

This repository contains a modular pipeline for binary face image classification (AI-generated vs real) using:

*a custom CNN (256×256 input)

*a fine-tuned ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet.

The codebase is organized to clearly separate data handling, models, training, evaluation, and utilities.
