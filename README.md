# DeepDetect — Repository Structure Overview

This repository contains a modular pipeline for **binary face image classification** (AI-generated vs real) using:
* A **custom CNN** ($256 \times 256$ input).
* A **fine-tuned ResNet50** pre-trained on ImageNet.

The codebase is organized to clearly separate **data handling, models, training, evaluation, and utilities**.
